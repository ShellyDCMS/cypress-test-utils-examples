## Practice using CypressTestHelper and the driver pattern
If you wish to get "hands-on", you can practice adding the pokemon-go component tests.

Main branch contains the following components

Let's add a "pokeomon-go" component, to fetch a pokemon by index.
You can eaither practice TDD - adding another failing test every time and then making it work by adding functionnallity
Or you can add tests only to the already implemented pokemon-go component, in that case, switch to `add-tests-workshop-starter` branch.

### Add your first integration test
