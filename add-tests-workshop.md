# Hands On Cypress tests workshop
If you wish to get "hands-on", you can practice adding the pokemon-go component tests.

## Prerequisits

`git clone https://github.com/ShellyDCMS/cypress-test-utils-examples`

`cd cypress-test-utils-examples`

`yarn`

`cd examples/<framework>/pokemon-catalog`

`yarn`

`npm run build`

`npm run start`

`npm run cy:open`


## Let's Go!

Main branch contains the following components

Let's add a "pokeomon-go" component, to fetch a pokemon by index.

You can eaither practice TDD - adding another failing test every time and then making it work by adding functionnallity
Or you can add tests only to the already implemented pokemon-go component; In that case, switch to `add-tests-workshop-starter` branch.

### Add your first integration test
