This is an example app to demonstrate the use of dell-cypress-test-utils test helpers to test a React application in all levels:
- Component (Testing a component in  the browser)
- Integration (Testing the entire Front End while intercepting http requests and mocking Back End responses)
- E2E

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
