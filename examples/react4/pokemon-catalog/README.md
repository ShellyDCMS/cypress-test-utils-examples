This is an example app to demonstrate the use of @shellygo/cypress-test-utils test helpers to test a React application in all levels:
- Component (Testing a component in  the browser)
- Integration (Testing the entire Front End while intercepting http requests and mocking Back End responses)
- E2E

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm cy:open`

Launches Cypress.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
